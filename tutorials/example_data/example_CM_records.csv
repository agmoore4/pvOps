The inverter fault page displayed a control pump fault. While engaging the door bypass, so that I could check the pump control fuses in the AC cabinet, I noticed that the Force Pump button was engaged. I also found that two of the three pump control fuses, F49 and F50, had cleared. F51 had not cleared. I then went to look at the pump and discovered that it had been leaking what looked like glycol. It did not look like the substance had been leaking from either intake or outtake hose, but from the bottom of the pump itself. The substance had dried and coagulated around the bottom of the pump. After sending pictures of my findings to Sam Delacruz and discussing what the next move should be, we decided to replace all three LP-CC-10 10 amp 600vac pump control fuses. Prior to replacing the fuses, I attempted to clean some of the dried substance, but proved to be too difficult without some sort of scotch brite pad. I enabled the inverter after carefully replacing the fuses, disengaging the pump, and clearing the fault. The inverter came back up and began exporting power. Upon leaving the site, C4 said that the inverter in question was not producing. When I went back to look at the inverter, it was not producing and the fault page was displaying IGBT health temp. fault. When I looked at the pump control fuse indicators, F51 was on. However, after checking the fuses for continuity, all were fine and none had cleared. I checked the line-to-line incoming AC voltage on the pump contactor and was not reading any voltage. Further investigation will be required by turning off the transformer, which I am not authorized to do. Jonathan Greene and myself will be coming back out next week to further troubleshoot. I will be posting pictures of the pump to BOX. Kevin from Berrago Solar onsite and replaced seal pump 07/11/2017. ",,NC,2015-10-07,6908.0,5010.0,Utility-scale,Fixed,central,Eaton Cooper Crouse-Hinds

None of the other inverters were in error, or warning according to the cluster controller. Power cycled cluster controller with no resolution. - Interfaced with the cluster controller, and verified no communications with 7 inverters. The communications outages are all over the array 4 map. - Power cycled ALL Pad 4 inverters (AC & DC), witnessed blue communication lights on all, and all went back into production with no issues. - At this time this communication outage is going to require more time to diagnose. I spent almost 2 hours trying the simple items as I was onsite. - At this time not sure exactly where the issues is. I'll need to troubleshoot / verify the wiring, inverter communication cards, and cluster controller before getting SMA involved at this point. 1/8/2019 Tim Chaput - Received approval for further troubleshooting. Will investigate further when onsite for POA cable replacements. 2/14/2019 Tim Chaput & Mike Duffy Cluster 4: I was able to identify 2 different shorts in the CAT 5 cables between 2 separate inverters which in essence cut off the communications with 8 of the inverters downstream on that cluster. Using Sunny Explorer, and an Ethernet cable tester I was able to narrow down where the faults were eventually. I did have some CAT 5 cable on-board so I replaced the cables between inverters 4-1-1 and 4-1-2, and the CAT 5 between 4-1-2 & 4-1-3 (marked with blue line on attached PDF). At this time communications have been fully restored for Cluster 4. Cluster 3: It appears Cluster 3 has multiple faults in the CAT 5 cables between inverter 3-1-1 to inverter 3-2-2. I was able to communicate upstream from inverter 3-1-5 (end of circuit) to inverter 3-1-1, but no further. I tried to communicate from inverter 3-2-5 downstream towards inverter 3-1-5, and could only communicate to inverter 3-2-3, and no further. I was able to communicate directly with all of the inverters in between so all SMA com modules are good. I tested the cabling with Ethernet tester, and the cables failed between 3-1-1 to 3-2-3. I did not have enough cable to replace these at the time, and need to order some CAT 5 shielded cable to make the repair. Inverter 2-4-4: This inverter also looks like there is a fault in the cable between 2-3-4 & 2-4-4. I can communicate with both directly, but do not see any inverters upstream from 2-4-4 (last inverter in the communications circuit). I tested the CAT 5 cable from 2-3-4 to 2-4-4, and this cable has a fault somewhere as well. Both RJ45 connectors look good, and I didn?t see any issues with them. It also looks like this cable may have been replaced in the past, as it was a different type of CAT 5 cable. Could be that it is just what they used during install, but it was the only cable I saw all day that was different. Again here, I did not have enough cable on-board to make this repair, but we know what it is now at least. 2/27/2019 Tim Chaput - Shielded CAT 5 cable ordered, to arrive 3/1/19.

Inverter 3.3 is faulted and not producing---Created By; Rush Ferrell on: 06/30/2017. 019 - Unplanned outage/derate,"I rolled out to Angel today to investigate a fault on inverter 3. The inverter fault page displayed a control pump fault. While engaging the door bypass, so that I could check the pump control fuses in the AC cabinet, I noticed that the Force Pump button was engaged. I also found that two of the three pump control fuses, F49 and F50, had cleared. F51 had not cleared. I then went to look at the pump and discovered that it had been leaking what looked like glycol. It did not look like the substance had been leaking from either intake or outtake hose, but from the bottom of the pump itself. The substance had dried and coagulated around the bottom of the pump. After sending pictures of my findings to Sam Delacruz and discussing what the next move should be, we decided to replace all three LP-CC-10 10 amp 600vac pump control fuses. Prior to replacing the fuses, I attempted to clean some of the dried substance, but proved to be too difficult without some sort of scotch brite pad. I enabled the inverter after carefully replacing the fuses, disengaging the pump, and clearing the fault. The inverter came back up and began exporting power. Upon leaving the site, C4 said that the inverter in question was not producing. When I went back to look at the inverter, it was not producing and the fault page was displaying IGBT health temp. fault. When I looked at the pump control fuse indicators, F51 was on. However, after checking the fuses for continuity, all were fine and none had cleared. I checked the line-to-line incoming AC voltage on the pump contactor and was not reading any voltage. Further investigation will be required by turning off the transformer, which I am not authorized to do. Jonathan Greene and myself will be coming back out next week to further troubleshoot. I will be posting pictures of the pump to BOX. Kevin from Berrago Solar onsite and replaced seal pump 07/11/2017.

Technician meeting IPCO tech at RRSR on 7/15 at 9AM local time Email from IPCO on 7/14: Hi Lydia, I have been getting complaints about Rail road solar (RRSR) near Vale Oregon. We tried testing the DDS circuit from Idaho Powers equipment at RRSR to the Boise end. The indications were that we only had 1 way communication from Boise to RRSR. So I put a loopback on the Century Link to IPCO cable(located in pole mounted box.) My test set that was on the other end showed that there was no signal. Putting a loopback on the Century link interface card made the Boise equipment happy-normal status. Sorry if this is hard to follow. A picture would be better lol Long story short it appears that the RLH fiber interface has an issue talking in one direction. The RLH link provides isolation between Ipco, the co-gen and Century link. If it would help, you could work out a time when the co-gen tech and an IPCO tech can meet out at RRSR to test. Thanks, Bryce. 001 - Ground fault",Whitecloud replaced some heat damaged fiber cables and connectors inside the Communications cabinet. Also all comm cards have been inspected for damage or failures.

Power analyzer installed at recloser control to capture event. 267 254 59 is the work order number for national grid ticket in case anyone needs to reference it along the way. 7/27/18 email status: The utility recloser is tripping on some unknown ground current / fault. This began happening 7/23/18 and trip events happened 7/23, 7/24, 7/26 x2. Inverters were not operational for a time prior to 7/20 when Ingeteam got them running again. The events captured at customer 651 are based on the voltage loss of the utility trip, and did not capture other detail of what is happening. Normally this site operates with circulating current when idle. We sent Ingeteam on site for troubleshooting of inverters. They checked for continuity between phases and phases to ground and did not find anything not expected. Possibilities for root cause to investigate: Site infrastructure - because of the circulating currents when idle, when the inverters are operational, we get current to ground at increasing levels relative to kW output. It may be we operate right at the ground current maximum under normal circumstances and something is causing voltages to shift slightly in recent conditions which tweaks the current into the trip threshold. There may be something wrong with a piece of utility equipment. If the event is coming from the utility, the utility recloser will likely trip before the customer recloser. The inverters should not be able to cause this event as they are synching to the grid and not creating voltages, they simply match it and tweak themselves higher so the current can flow in synch to match the source circuit. For a while I was trying to figure out how the smart grounding board and inverter synch boards could be doing something weird, but I can't get to a point where they are injecting current to neutral or ground that it shouldn't. There are no settings active for power factor improvements and so forth. The utility dispatch team we deal with for reclose requests doesn't do troubleshooting, they handle emergencies, so we need to open a ticket with an engineering group on the issue. Confirm that the bonding in the transformers is what we want and the final iteration was captured in as builts. Ryan is going on site to close in the utility. While there he is going to put a logging meter at our 651 so that we can capture data at higher sample rate than the DAS. The DAS is capturing raw data every 3 minutes or so - we need much smaller to hope to capture anything. A similar issue occurred at Upton when a car took out a utility pole at Upton. The utility re-routed our feeder circuit temporarily. On that circuit when the utility closed in their recloser, and then we closed in ours, the transformer surge drove the ground current at the utility recloser to trip at >12A @ 13.8kV. I was able to close in one at a time there and that worked until the inverters started to inject and then it tripped that circuit again. Once the utility moved us back to our 'regular' circuit we were able to operate at the 'regular' ~12A ground current. Next steps: NAMS to open a ticket with engineering at utility. Collect data on site with temporary metering. NAMS to get site closed in this morning. Set customer 651 to trip faster on ground events so even if event comes from the grid, we may be able to trip our side off and not lose utility AC, which is a truck roll and time killer to restore. PC, DR - can you confirm that the as builts are accurate as far as actual grounding and bonding locations (high side neutral bonded to ground, no neutral to zigzag, zigzag has ground reference (I am not sure where this is bonded).

Check Inv Circuit and Contactors.  Shut down Inverter. Visual inspection seems to show a possible arc behind middle section stacks.  We copied and saved the data from SD card then proceeded to turn Inverter back on. Inverter SEA did come back to life and is back generating electricity.  We verified through PVG that the inverter is producing.  I am leaving the ticket open as we will be keeping our eye on this inverter in the event it kicks back off and we need to further the investigation.

12/11/18 B Gottwald, A Gora - Inverter shut down along with all others due to the snow on 12/9. Performed a power cycle, and it shut down withing an hour, then started back up on its own. If the problem persists, we will seek advice from Eric Nessl about what he did last time to fix this.

2019-02-20 B Gottwald 14:00 Arrived onsite, display showed contactor / electronics error. Performed a power cycle, no success.  Display was showing similar voltage countdown to what SEA was doing so I opened the left cabinet and inspected the Stacks. There was no visible physical evidence of damage to stacks. Turned inverter back on, again no start up, so I shut it down intending to tighten the Auxiliary relay on the AC Contactor, inspect the X5 connection and collect SD Card data, but rain started. I was only able to tighten the Auxiliary Relay.  Upon restarting the inverter, I could hear one of the contactors repeatedly trying to close. Inverter did not start up.  Will need better weather to perform a complete diagnostic.

2019-02-21 B Gottwald 12:45 - Opened Inverter, verified Aux Relay connections tight, and X5 on board was tight.  Turned inverter back on and observed that DC Contactors closed in, but AC Contactor did not.  Sent Request for Quote to SMA, and will forward it to E Nessl once it arrives.

2/25/19 A Gora  SMA sent quote and suggests changing AC Cotactor and AC auxiliary contact.  I sent the SD card date to Auston Taber of Solar Support to get a second opinion/diagnosis.  He is currently looking into this for us.

2/27/19 R Pruitt  when to the site to replace a part at SWB inverter  set on site to see if the rain would let up to do the work did not  so i check out 

2/27/19  A Gora - Went to replace Auxiliary Contact per Auston Tabors advice.  He also asked that we call while on site to do further troubleshooting.  Taking a closer look at the AC Contactor revealed that 3 of the 4 bolts holding the contactor cover on were missing.  I found them laying i the bottom of the inverter.  The fourth bolt was about to fall out.  I called Cliff Myers of Solar Support for help with the diagnosis.  He advised that I remove the cover of the contactor to see if any internal parts were blown.  Upon doing so we found a disconnected wire that is powered by a coil.  I reattached the wire.  I got all bolts out of the bottom of the inverter and reassembled the contactor correctly.  The Auxiliary Contact was also replaced.  I called the NOC the confirm they could communicate with the inverter.  It was unable to produce at that point as it was 730 pm.
