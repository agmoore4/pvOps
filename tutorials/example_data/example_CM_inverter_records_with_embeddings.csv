Entropy workers had the modules replaced within 30 minutes. CCR then inspected the work, connected the Source Circuit wiring to the String Wiring and took voltage measurements to ensure proper Voc. The fuses in the CB were tested and tested OK. All string touch-safe fuse holders were closed in with the exception of the string that was just addressed with the repair.

The issue continued until today. 17 August: Today (17 Aug) the comms never came online this morning. We went back to the field and tried to reset the inverter at the HMI and this was not successful. I called Martin again and he walked us through the process of reloading the HMI software using an SD card from the neighboring inverter. We followed his steps exactly but this did not bring the inverter back online. Martin is scheduled to come out tomorrow and he will be bringing an new HMI. 23 August: Kaco has been working on site since Monday (21 August) performing the PRC-024 inverter software updates. I had them evaluate E-B5-1 again. As we monitored E-B5 throughout the day, we noticed that when it was communicating E-B7 was not, and when E-B7 was communicating E-B5 was not. Once we explained that to the Kaco technician, they went back to E-B5 and reprogrammed the HMI. The issue was that E-B5 and E-B7 had the same addresses.
