Upon investigation, we discovered that a skid-steer operator from HBC (working on the site roads per Punchlist) hit two modules. This caused a Ground Fault in the array and tripped the inverter offline. Pictures Attached. Work Performed: We alerted Entropy (as they are the responsible contractor) and HBC. The supervisors for both came to the location. In an effort to get the inverter back online asap, CCR took lead. CCR Opened and LOTO'd the applicable CB. We then cleared and reset the inverter. It came back online with no issues. It was producing again by 1130. At that time, Entropy was cleared to replace the broken modules. CCR ensured the Source-Circuits were unplugged before work began. Entropy workers had the modules replaced within 30 minutes. CCR then inspected the work, connected the Source Circuit wiring to the String Wiring and took voltage measurements to ensure proper Voc. The fuses in the CB were tested and tested OK. All string touch-safe fuse holders were closed in with the exception of the string that was just addressed with the repair. The CB was then CLOSED in and voltage/current measurements were taken to ensure there were no issues. Lastly, the repaired string was closed in and held with no issues. The area was cleaned and cleared with no issues and all repairs were successful..

Inverter E-B5-1 has intermittent communications.---Created By; Joseph Sheffield on: 08/17/2017. 020 - Data/Communication System Outage,"14 August: E-B5-1 is the new inverter that was commissioned last week. It has had intermittent comms since Monday (14 Aug). It would go down and then come back up. I called Martin (Kaco tech) on Monday and he said to monitor it. The issue continued until today. 17 August: Today (17 Aug) the comms never came online this morning. We went back to the field and tried to reset the inverter at the HMI and this was not successful. I called Martin again and he walked us through the process of reloading the HMI software using an SD card from the neighboring inverter. We followed his steps exactly but this did not bring the inverter back online. Martin is scheduled to come out tomorrow and he will be bringing an new HMI. 23 August: Kaco has been working on site since Monday (21 August) performing the PRC-024 inverter software updates. I had them evaluate E-B5-1 again. As we monitored E-B5 throughout the day, we noticed that when it was communicating E-B7 was not, and when E-B7 was communicating E-B5 was not. Once we explained that to the Kaco technician, they went back to E-B5 and reprogrammed the HMI. The issue was that E-B5 and E-B7 had the same addresses. That has been fixed now and both E-B7 and E-B5 are communicating normally now..

Technician cycled them and placed them in the CLOSED position. 4) GFI breaker was visually checked and found to be in the CLOSED position. 5) The inverter was closed back up and restarted according to the manufacturer's instructions. 6) The inverter came back online and began production after the mandatory AC sync period..
