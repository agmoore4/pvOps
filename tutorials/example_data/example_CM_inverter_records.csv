At that time, the technician, with advice of Eaton, checked connections on the CAUX2 board and the Temperature Transducer.

Inlet Water Temp [THM16], Inverter Fault H","Inverter faulted out on ""Water Temp"" Fault. I found coolant temp to be 20C and Pressure to be 22 PSI. I informed Sam Delacruz of this as he has diagnosed it as a bad CAUX board and temp transducer but I think coolant needs to be added also. I restarted inverter 2x and each time it faulted on the same fault. I traced wire number 5023 from the TT to the CAUX board, checked connections, measured violtages and confirmed termination connectivity. After this restart, the inverter faulted again. Leaving this as a CAUX board - TT fault and only part replacement will enable a successful restart. Part arrived at Eaton Morrisville office on 9/22. Andy Clack is picking it up. 9/22/17, I replaced the CAUX 2 board and temperature transducer. The inverter was still throwing the coolant faults. I called Sam, the new boards have DIP switchs that need to be set. Number 1 has to be off, 2 through 8 has to be on. Also there are jumpers that need to be taken off the old CAUX board, JIN 4 through 9. The jumpers must be installed on the new board on the same JIN 4 through 9.

Inverter 3.3 is faulted and not producing---Created By; Rush Ferrell on: 06/30/2017. 019 - Unplanned outage/derate,"I rolled out to Angel today to investigate a fault on inverter 3. The inverter fault page displayed a control pump fault. While engaging the door bypass, so that I could check the pump control fuses in the AC cabinet, I noticed that the Force Pump button was engaged. I also found that two of the three pump control fuses, F49 and F50, had cleared. F51 had not cleared. I then went to look at the pump and discovered that it had been leaking what looked like glycol. It did not look like the substance had been leaking from either intake or outtake hose, but from the bottom of the pump itself. The substance had dried and coagulated around the bottom of the pump. After sending pictures of my findings to Sam Delacruz and discussing what the next move should be, we decided to replace all three LP-CC-10 10 amp 600vac pump control fuses. Prior to replacing the fuses, I attempted to clean some of the dried substance, but proved to be too difficult without some sort of scotch brite pad. I enabled the inverter after carefully replacing the fuses, disengaging the pump, and clearing the fault. The inverter came back up and began exporting power. Upon leaving the site, C4 said that the inverter in question was not producing. When I went back to look at the inverter, it was not producing and the fault page was displaying IGBT health temp. fault. When I looked at the pump control fuse indicators, F51 was on. However, after checking the fuses for continuity, all were fine and none had cleared. I checked the line-to-line incoming AC voltage on the pump contactor and was not reading any voltage. Further investigation will be required by turning off the transformer, which I am not authorized to do. Jonathan Greene and myself will be coming back out next week to further troubleshoot. I will be posting pictures of the pump to BOX. Kevin from Berrago Solar onsite and replaced seal pump 07/11/2017.

After verifying absence of voltage and getting into the invterter it was clear there had been an electrical fire.  Upon further inspection its clear that a stack has blown and will need to be replaced.  I will submit asset management an email with this information.

2/25/19  A Gora, R Pruitt -  Today we did an entire stack job on inverter SE-A.  All 3 stacks were replaced  per SOP.  Issue has been resolved and production has been verified though the NOC.

2019-02-20 B Gottwald 14:00 Arrived onsite, display showed contactor / electronics error. Performed a power cycle, no success.  Display was showing similar voltage countdown to what SEA was doing so I opened the left cabinet and inspected the Stacks. There was no visible physical evidence of damage to stacks. Turned inverter back on, again no start up, so I shut it down intending to tighten the Auxiliary relay on the AC Contactor, inspect the X5 connection and collect SD Card data, but rain started. I was only able to tighten the Auxiliary Relay.  Upon restarting the inverter, I could hear one of the contactors repeatedly trying to close. Inverter did not start up.  Will need better weather to perform a complete diagnostic.

2019-02-21 B Gottwald 12:45 - Opened Inverter, verified Aux Relay connections tight, and X5 on board was tight.  Turned inverter back on and observed that DC Contactors closed in, but AC Contactor did not.  Sent Request for Quote to SMA, and will forward it to E Nessl once it arrives.

2/25/19 A Gora  SMA sent quote and suggests changing AC Cotactor and AC auxiliary contact.  I sent the SD card date to Auston Taber of Solar Support to get a second opinion/diagnosis.  He is currently looking into this for us.

2/27/19 R Pruitt  when to the site to replace a part at SWB inverter  set on site to see if the rain would let up to do the work did not  so i check out 

2/27/19  A Gora - Went to replace Auxiliary Contact per Auston Tabors advice.  He also asked that we call while on site to do further troubleshooting.  Taking a closer look at the AC Contactor revealed that 3 of the 4 bolts holding the contactor cover on were missing.  I found them laying i the bottom of the inverter.  The fourth bolt was about to fall out.  I called Cliff Myers of Solar Support for help with the diagnosis.  He advised that I remove the cover of the contactor to see if any internal parts were blown.  Upon doing so we found a disconnected wire that is powered by a coil.  I reattached the wire.  I got all bolts out of the bottom of the inverter and reassembled the contactor correctly.  The Auxiliary Contact was also replaced.  I called the NOC the confirm they could communicate with the inverter.  It was unable to produce at that point as it was 730 pm.  

2/28/19  A Gora - I have confirmed via PVG and with the NOC that inveter SW-B is now online and producing..

The inverter fault page displayed a control pump fault. While engaging the door bypass, so that I could check the pump control fuses in the AC cabinet, I noticed that the Force Pump button was engaged. I also found that two of the three pump control fuses, F49 and F50, had cleared. F51 had not cleared. I then went to look at the pump and discovered that it had been leaking what looked like glycol. It did not look like the substance had been leaking from either intake or outtake hose, but from the bottom of the pump itself. The substance had dried and coagulated around the bottom of the pump. After sending pictures of my findings to Sam Delacruz and discussing what the next move should be, we decided to replace all three LP-CC-10 10 amp 600vac pump control fuses. Prior to replacing the fuses, I attempted to clean some of the dried substance, but proved to be too difficult without some sort of scotch brite pad. I enabled the inverter after carefully replacing the fuses, disengaging the pump, and clearing the fault. The inverter came back up and began exporting power. Upon leaving the site, C4 said that the inverter in question was not producing. When I went back to look at the inverter, it was not producing and the fault page was displaying IGBT health temp. fault. When I looked at the pump control fuse indicators, F51 was on. However, after checking the fuses for continuity, all were fine and none had cleared. I checked the line-to-line incoming AC voltage on the pump contactor and was not reading any voltage. Further investigation will be required by turning off the transformer, which I am not authorized to do. Jonathan Greene and myself will be coming back out next week to further troubleshoot. I will be posting pictures of the pump to BOX. Kevin from Berrago Solar onsite and replaced seal pump 07/11/2017.
